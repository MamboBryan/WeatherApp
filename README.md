### Weather App

*Summary*

A simple weather app that displays the forecast for the current day and a few days after that.

*API :* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Reason for choosing mentioned API :
- 1000 free api calls per day, good for a small project.
- Ability to specify different units in requests and receive a formatted response based on the unit i.e imperial/metric etc.
- Api response can also be modified to include the amount of needed data all with one call ,
contains icons for different conditions and has multilingual support if adopting for a wider audience is ever needed.
- They have a large user base and handle millions of requests, if the app were ever to scale, there's confidence on the api providing high availability.
